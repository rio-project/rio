class Card(component_base.FundamentalComponent):
    """
    A container that visually encompasses its child components.

    Cards are used to group related components together, and to visually
    separate them from other components, allowing you to display them in a
    structured way.

    Cards are also often used as large buttons. They can be configured to
    elevate slightly when the mouse hovers over them, indicating to the user
    that they support interaction.

    Attributes:
        child: The component to display inside the card.

        corner_radius: The radius of the card's corners. If set to `None`, it
            is picked from the active theme.

        on_press: An event handler that is called when the card is clicked.
            Note that attaching an even handler will also modify the appearance
            of the card, to signal the possible interaction to the user. See
            `elevate_on_hover` and `colorize_on_hover` for details.

        elevate_on_hover: Whether the card should elevate slightly when the
            mouse hovers over it. If set to `None` the card will elevate if
            an `on_press` event handler is attached.

        colorize_on_hover: Whether the card should change its color when the
            mouse hovers over it. If set to `None` the card will change its
            color if an `on_press` event handler is attached.
