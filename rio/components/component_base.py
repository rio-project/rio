    """
    Base class for all `rio` components.

    Components are the building blocks of `rio` apps. `rio` ships with many useful
    components out of the box, but you can also subclass a component to create your
    own.

    Attributes:
        key: A unique identifier for this component. If two components with the same
            key are present during reconciliation they will be considered the
            same component and their state will be preserved. If no key is
            specified, reconciliation falls back to a less precise method, by
            comparing the location of the component in the component tree.

        margin: The margin around this component. This is a shorthand for setting
            `margin_left`, `margin_top`, `margin_right` and `margin_bottom` to
            the same value. If multiple conflicting margins are specified the
            most specific one wins. If for example `margin` and `margin_left`
            are both specified, `margin_left` is used for the left side, while
            the other sides use `margin`.

        margin_x: The horizontal margin around this component. This is a shorthand
            for setting `margin_left` and `margin_right` to the same value. If
            multiple conflicting margins are specified the most specific one
            wins. If for example `margin_x` and `margin_left` are both
            specified, `margin_left` is used for the left side, while the other
            side uses `margin_x`.

        margin_y: The vertical margin around this component. This is a shorthand
            for setting `margin_top` and `margin_bottom` to the same value. If
            multiple conflicting margins are specified the most specific one
            wins. If for example `margin_y` and `margin_top` are both specified,
            `margin_top` is used for the top side, while the other side uses
            `margin_y`.

        margin_left: The left margin around this component. If multiple conflicting
            margins are specified this one will be used, since it's the most
            specific. If for example `margin_left` and `margin` are both
            specified, `margin_left` is used for the left side, while the other
            sides use `margin`.

        margin_top: The top margin around this component. If multiple conflicting
            margins are specified this one will be used, since it's the most
            specific. If for example `margin_top` and `margin` are both
            specified, `margin_top` is used for the top side, while the other
            sides use `margin`.

        margin_right: The right margin around this component. If multiple
            conflicting margins are specified this one will be used, since it's
            the most specific. If for example `margin_right` and `margin` are
            both specified, `margin_right` is used for the right side, while the
            other sides use `margin`.

        margin_bottom: The bottom margin around this component. If multiple
            conflicting margins are specified this one will be used, since it's
            the most specific. If for example `margin_bottom` and `margin` are
            both specified, `margin_bottom` is used for the bottom side, while
            the other sides use `margin`.

        width: How much horizontal space this component should request during
            layouting. This can be either a number, or one of the special
            values:

            If `"natural"`, the component will request the minimum amount it
            requires to fit on the screen. For example a `Text` will request
            however much space the characters of that text require. A `Row`
            would request the sum of the widths of its children.

            If `"grow"`, the component will request all the remaining space in its
            parent.

            Please note that the space a `Component` receives during layouting may
            not match the request. As a general rule for example, containers try
            to pass on all available space to children. If you really want a
            `Component` to only take up as much space as requested, consider
            specifying an alignment.

        height: How much vertical space this component should request during
            layouting. This can be either a number, or one of the special
            values:

            If `"natural"`, the component will request the minimum amount it
            requires to fit on the screen. For example a `Text` will request
            however much space the characters of that text require. A `Row`
            would request the height of its tallest child.

            If `"grow"`, the component will request all the remaining space in its
            parent.

            Please note that the space a `Component` receives during layouting may
            not match the request. As a general rule for example, containers try
            to pass on all available space to children. If you really want a
            `Component` to only take up as much space as requested, consider
            specifying an alignment.

        align_x: How this component should be aligned horizontally, if it receives
            more space than it requested. This can be a number between 0 and 1,
            where 0 means left-aligned, 0.5 means centered, and 1 means
            right-aligned.

        align_y: How this component should be aligned vertically, if it receives
            more space than it requested. This can be a number between 0 and 1,
            where 0 means top-aligned, 0.5 means centered, and 1 means
            bottom-aligned.
