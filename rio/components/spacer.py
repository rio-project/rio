    # Spacer
    Adds empty space.

    Spacers are invisible components which add empty space between other
    components. While similar effects can often be achieved using margins and
    alignment, code with spacers can sometimes be easier to read.

    Note that unlike most components in Rio, `Spacer` does not have a `natural`
    size. Therefore it defaults to a width and height of `grow`, as that is how
    they're frequently used.

    ## Example:
    A simple `Spacer` with a height of 5:
    ```python
    rio.Spacer(height=5)
    ```
