class Page:
    """
    A routable page in a Rio app.

    Rio apps can consist of many pages. You might have a welcome page, a
    settings page, a login, and so on. `Page` components contain all information
    needed to display those pages, as well as to navigate between them.

    A minimal example:

    ```python
    import rio

    app = rio.App(
        build=lambda: rio.Column(
            rio.Text("Welcome to my page!"), rio.PageView(
                width="grow", height="grow",
            ),
        ), pages=[
            rio.Page(
                "", build=lambda: rio.Text("This is the home page"),
            ), rio.Page(
                "subpage", build=lambda: rio.Text("This is a subpage"),
            ),
        ],
    )

    app.run_in_browser()
    ```

    This will display "This is the home page" when navigating to the root URL,
    but "This is a subpage" when navigating to "/subpage". Note that on both
    pages the text "Welcome to my page!" is displayed above the page content.
    That's because it's not part of the `PageView`.

    # TODO: Link to the routing/multipage how-to page

    Attributes:
        page_url: The URL segment at which this page should be displayed. For
            example, if this is "subpage", then the page will be displayed at
            "https://yourapp.com/subpage". If this is "", then the page will be
            displayed at the root URL.

        build: A callback that is called when this page is displayed. It should
            return a Rio component.

        children: A list of child pages. These pages will be displayed when
            navigating to a sub-URL of this page. For example, if this page's
            `page_url` is "page1", and it has a child page with `page_url`
            "page2", then the child page will be displayed at
            "https://yourapp.com/page1/page2".

        guard: A callback that is called before this page is displayed. It
            can prevent users from accessing pages which they are not allowed to
            see. For example, you may want to redirect users to your login page
            if they are trying to access their profile page without being
            logged in.

            The callback should return `None` if the user is allowed to access
            the page, or a string or `rio.URL` if the user should be redirected
            to a different page.

    Raises `NavigationFailed` if navigation to the target URL is not possible
    because of an error, such as an exception in a guard.

    If the URL points to a page which doesn't exist that is not considered an
    error. The result will still be valid. That is because navigation is
    possible, it's just that some PageViews will display a 404 page.
